# Bikesharing NYC CitiBike Analysis
## Module 14: NYC Citibike with Tableau

## Overview and Purpose

- The primary objective is to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa is a lucrative and solid business proposal. To solidify the proposal, one of the key methods is to analyze existing data from New York City and create a customer/user Bike Trip Analysis.
- For this analysis, I used Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, I created a set of visualizations with the following objectives:

1. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
2. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week.
3. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
4. Finally, I will add these new visualizations two I created earlier this year for my final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
